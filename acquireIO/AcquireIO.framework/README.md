Open the file in your project named `info.plist`, right click it, opening as Source Code, paste this code below to it. Or you can open  `info.plist` as `Property List` by default, click the add button, Xcode will give you the suggest completions while typing Privacy - with the help of keyboard and 

Remember to write your description why you ask for this authorization, between  `<string>` and `</string>`, or your app will be rejected by apple:
